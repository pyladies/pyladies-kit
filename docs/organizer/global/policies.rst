Policies
========

We try not to have too many rules and regulations (everything else in this kit has been nothing more than advice we offer to make things easier for you, given that we learned much of it the hard way). Generally, local group organizers are free to do whatever they want, as long as it’s in the best interest of their local group and/or PyLadies in general.

The following policies have been written up so that you may simply copy and paste them into email responses, to help you deal with awkward or tricky situations.

Trademark
---------

PyLadies and the PyLadies logo are trademarks of the Python Software Foundation. For usage guidelines, please read :doc:`../../misc/logo`.

Code of Conduct
---------------

All PyLadies events (Meetups, conference lunches, etc), online spaces (IRC, Facebook, etc) are beholden to the PyLadies :doc:`../../coc`.

Every PyLadies location is **required** to make :doc:`../../coc` public in some way.  For instance, PyLadies SF has a dedicated `page`_ on their Meetup space.  The ``#pyladies`` IRC channel on Freenode has a link to the `main website's`_ Code of Conduct in the topic of the channel.

Please read :doc:`../difficult/responding` for how to appropriately deal with CoC violations.

Guest Policy
------------

(If anyone asks to stay with you in the future other than a trusted friend, say something like "I wish we could accommodate you, but
PyLadies has a strict policy of not allowing members to host out-of-town guests" and then paste this, minus the parenthetical note.)

In the interest of safety and security of our members, PyLadies organizers, volunteers, and members are not permitted to host overnight out-of-town guests who wish to visit town for PyLadies events.

This is a strict formal policy, chosen to ensure that the PyLadies organization continues to be taken seriously and treated with complete respect by the professional software and tech communities.

Controversial Issues
--------------------

As a PyLadies local group organizer, you may be asked for PyLadies’ position on controversial issues. Often, these are diversity-related issues.

PyLadies’ policy is to have no official position on controversial issues. By choosing this policy, we allow ourselves to be a group full of diverse ideas and differing viewpoints.
