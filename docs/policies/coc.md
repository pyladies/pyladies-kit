# Code of Conduct

## Policy

All PyLadies events (Meetups, conference lunches, etc), online spaces (Slack, Facebook, etc) are beholden to the PyLadies {ref}`coc`.

Every PyLadies location is **required** to make {ref}`coc` public in some way. For instance, PyLadies SF has a dedicated [page] on their Meetup space.
The {ref}`PyLadies Slack org<slack>` `#general` channel has a link to the [main website's] Code of Conduct in the topic of the channel.

If you can not find the following {ref}`coc`` posted somewhere (e.g. wherever they post events), please reach out to your chapter's organizers.

Please see {ref}`coc-report` for how to report a CoC violation.

Please see {ref}`coc-respond` for how to appropriately respond with a CoC violation.

## Code of Conduct

PyLadies is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This does not only extend to members to local PyLadies communities, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger PyLadies community of users, developers and integrators through events or interactions.

Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, IRC/Slack chats, electronic meetings, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the community may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any PyLadies event, or expulsion from mailing lists, IRC/Slack chats, discussion boards and other electronic communications channels to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion from PyLadies Meetup group membership.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from any member of the PyLadies community, IRC/Slack chat admins, website admins, or organizers/representatives of any physical events put on under the auspices of PyLadies.
