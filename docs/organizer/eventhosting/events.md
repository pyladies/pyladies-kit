## Event Types

### Organizer Events

Very useful for planning sessions, but also for support and accountability.

### Python Ladies' Nights

The PyLadies aren’t ALL about coding -- we also love to socialize and have fun!

Hosted: a potluck/party at a member’s house
Meet: at a bar or restaurant

### Workshops

You can host workshops either as full-day events every 1-3 months or so, or as evening events that occur weekly.

#### Intro to Python

1. Austin PyLadies [Intro to Python].
2. PyStar has some great tutorials for beginners.
3. Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw
4. custom (depending on your needs)

#### Intro to Django

1. Poll tutorial from [Django Docs].
2. Sandy Strong's [Intro to Django Workshop slides].

#### Other topic of interest workshop

1. Find a programming/relevant developer book that you’d like to study. Host a weekly study group.
2. Host a weekend workshop about game programming, startups, journalism, etc.

### Hackathons/Sprints

LA PyLadies has hosted hackathons where attendees bring laptops and projects of their own to work on. Beginners are pointed to [learnpythonthehardway.org](http://learnpythonthehardway.org) and instructed to work through the tutorial, asking for help as needed. They are urged to post exercises to Github, as a way to dip their toes in the world of open source sofware.

Hackathons can be evening, full-day, or all-weekend events.

### Virtual meetups

PyLadiesAU held their first group meeting as a virtual meetup. See [Australian PyLadies] for details.

The {ref}`PyLadies Slack org <slack>` is always available for anyone to use for virtual meetups. Feel free to create a `#{{chaptername}}-{{eventname}}` channel.

### Meetups as part of a Python user group (PUG) meetup

A PyLadies event can be as simple as women getting together and talking about each others’ Python projects in a small group after a local PUG event.

Anything to encourage women to attend and continue attending PUGs is great. Talk to your local PUG organizers and ask for their help and support in having a post-PUG informal PyLadies meetup.

You might also consider trying to give a {doc}`talks/beginner` at a  meetup. This can help bring more beginners who might otherwise be  scared away to the group.

### Code review sessions

Reviewing someone’s coding project together can help everyone learn better coding practices.

### Conference prep sessions

Python conferences that might interest your group: PyCon, DjangoCon, PloneConf, SciPy (Python for Scientific Computing)

What you can do to prepare together:

1. Brainstorm talk ideas. Help each other put together talk outlines.
2. Review each others’ talk proposals.
3. Practice talks in front of each other, in a small group.
4. Practice in a larger group, as a joint event with the local Python user group.

Conferences can be stressful, but they’re also a lot of fun, particularly if you’re attending with a friend or a small group. There's also a good chance you will run into PyLadies from other groups!

## Event Checklist

So you’re ready to host an event?

### To host an event

- Decide the type of event.  Examples:
  : - Hack night/hack weekend
    - Sprinting on an Open Source project (e.g. Django, CPython, etc)
    - Workshop - introductory Python, intermediate, intro to Git, anything
    - Study group
    - Coffee & hack
    - Speaker series/lightning talks
    - Check out ideas on other locations' websites and meetup pages.
- Email local tech companies to ask for event hosting support:
  : - You can find companies that use Python by looking at their job boards, and other Python group events
    - If you're in a bigger city, choose a location that can be easily accessible via public transit, or have ample parking
    - Cold-email a general email address if you don't have an actual contact at the company.  This is still highly effective!
      : - Be upfront with what you need; just hosting space?  Space and food? For how many people?
        - Include proposed dates/times
        - Offer time during the event for them to pitch their product(s) and/or any job openings
        - Ask for a description of the type of space available; feel free to ask to check it out beforehand
        - Events often need wifi for attendees, and if it's an event longer than a few hours, then easy-to-access power outlets are needed as well
        - Be mindful of the company's RSVP/check in wishes if they have any.  Do they want First & Last name? Will there be alcohol served, and therefore ID needs to be checked?
- Once date & event is set with the host, post up the event on Meetup.com group
  : - Be sure to setup the RSVP limits if space is limited.  Apprehend about 50%-60% of RSVPs will actually show up (if it's a free event).
    - Give an exact address; Meetup.com allows you to hide the address to non-group members.
    - Be *clear* on who can attend.  Women only?  Women and a guest of +1 (of either gender)? Both women and men?  Complete n00bs to Python?  Or solid Pythonistas?
    - Detail what is needed to be prepared for the event.  Just bring themselves?  Do they need their computer?  Prior knowledge?
    - Be explicit if there will be food/drinks or not so folks and plan ahead.
- If hosting a workshop, solicit for mentors.
  : - Have an easy sign-up sheet for mentors (perhaps a Google Docs form).
    - Prep the mentors by detailing what you plan on doing, what your expectations are for the event, how best they can help
    - Often times, it's hard to get all-female mentors.  Most of the time, male mentors are very nice and helpful.
- A few days before the event, email RSVP'd folks to update their RSVP status if they are no longer going.  This is especially nice if folks are on a waiting list for the event.
- Arrive a little early; folks will always arrive before doors officially open
- Have nametags for attendees.  If having a workshop, have mentors wear nametags and perhaps a special sticker or something to designate that they are mentors.
- Post any resources for the event - either before or afterwards.
- Have fun!
