Finding Organizers
==================

What to say at a meetup
-----------------------

Go to your local Python, Linux, and other relevant meetups.  Ask if you can make an announcement at the meetup.  Say that:

* You're interested in improving gender diversity in the Python community.  Anyone interested should meet you right after the meetup in X corner of the room.

* You've heard about the PyLadies women's Python user group program and need help starting a local chapter

    * It's okay if the chapter just starts with 2 ladies and 1 supporting gentleman at first.  It'll grow over time as you plan events and women come out of the woodwork to join.


If you're a woman, say that:

* You want to bring female Python devs of all experience levels together and do fun things, while helping each other succeed as Python developers

    * doing ladies' nights out
    * meeting up to work on conference talk proposals
    * joining in on the global PyLadies hack nights

* You also want to get more beginner women into doing Python by doing 


If you're a man, say that:

* You've seen the success of the women's Python user group/workshop movement happening all over the world. You need help from both genders in making it happen in your city.

* Explicitly mention that you want to let any interested women lead the PyLadies chapter, and that you just want to be there to help and show support.  

    * The Python community needs more female leaders!
    * This is your opportunity to mentor and empower women to take a more active leadership role

* Mention examples of fun women's Python events that you'd like to help make happen in your city.  LPTHW/PyStar workshops, conference speaker mentoring sessions aimed at women but also open to men, Python-themed Girl Geek dinners, etc.

What to say right after the meetup
----------------------------------

While you have everyone's attention & excitement, plan your first 2 events:

* Get a group together to meet at a coffee shop, office, or house to participate in the next PyLadies global hack night.

* Plan a beginner women's Python workshop 1.5 to 2 months out.

Forms to fill out before anyone leaves:

1. List of women who want to be co-organizers of the PyLadies chapter.  Encourage all the present female devs to sign up for this one.
2. List of people of both genders who want to participate but not lead.  Encourage any present female non-devs (e.g. non-technical entrepreneurs) to sign up for this one.
3. Names/emails of other non-present local female Python devs

Have one of the more excited women co-organizers (if not yourself) take home all the forms along with this set of instructions.
