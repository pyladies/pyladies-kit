# Outstanding PyLady Award

:::{important}
**This award is brand new as of January 22nd, 2024!** 
ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
The complete award process has not been [fully hammered out](#remaining-details), but the Global 
Council wants to invite nominations for this award in time for PyCon US 2024.
:::

The PyLadies community is made up of many remarkable members and volunteers that make significant 
contributions to bettering the Python community. The Global Council's Outstanding PyLady award is 
meant to elevate diverse Pythonistas doing amazing things, to highlight their achievements, and 
to thank them for all the work they've contributed. The intention of this award is to demonstrate 
that service to the Python community does lead to recognition and reward, rather than to provide a 
direct incentive to contributors.

Awards will be made periodically (a few times a year), although the Global Council may choose to 
consider awards more or less frequently. The award is open to women and non-binary PyLadies. Any
Python community member may nominate a PyLady at any time. Self-nominations are accepted. Nominations
must be made through [this Google form] (optionally anonymous). The Council will contact nominators to
keep them informed of the status of their nominations.

While it would be unusual and rare for a single individual to receive multiple Outstanding PyLady 
awards, or to be awarded the Outstanding PyLady Award after receiving a PSF [Community] or 
[Distinguished] Service Awards for the same contributions, repeated awards may be appropriate to 
acknowledge ongoing or new contributions. 

Current sitting members of the Global Council may not be considered for the award while they are 
serving on the Council. However, they may be awarded for their contributions after having served.
Nominators who wish to recognize a current Global Council member may consider submitting a nomination 
to the [PSF] for a [Community] Service Award or [Distinguished] Service Award.

Award winners will be recognized at the next PyCon US. While nominations are accepted year-round, the 
cut-off date to have nominations considered in time for the upcoming PyCon is the end of the 
previous year. For instance, for PyCon US 2025, nominations must be received by December 31st, 2024 
[AOE]. This is to give enough time for the Council to review nominations, and for award winners to 
make travel arrangements for the conference.

:::{attention}
**PyCon 2024 timing**: Since the Council is just announcing this award, for the first year, we're 
accepting nominations until February 4th, 2024 [AOE]. Nominations received after this date will
still be considered, but may not be notified in time for PyCon US 2024.

## Recognition

Winners of the Outstanding PyLady award will be notified by the Global Council.

Recognition will take the form of an award certificate, plus **one** of the following:

1. Free registration and travel assistance (if needed) to the following PyCon US[^1] ; or
2. A cash award of $1000 USD (Non-US based recipients will be subject to the Federal US tax 
withholding of 30% unless all requirements are met, according to the Python Software Foundation's 
[Vendor Policies]. Contact [accounting[at]python.org][acctpsf] with any questions).

[^1]: An award winner may choose a future PyCon US if they can not attend the next upcoming conference.

Historical winners will be listed on this page as well as on PyLadies' social media outlets and blog, 
but awardees may elect to opt out of any publication of their names, as well as remove their names
if personal preferences change.
