# Outstanding PyLady Award

:::{important}
**This award is brand new as of January 22nd, 2024!** 
ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
The complete award process has not been [fully hammered out](#remaining-details), but the Global 
Council wants to invite nominations for this award in time for PyCon US 2024.
:::

The PyLadies community is made up of many remarkable members and volunteers that make significant 
contributions to bettering the Python community. The Global Council's Outstanding PyLady award is 
meant to elevate diverse Pythonistas doing amazing things, to highlight their achievements, and 
to thank them for all the work they've contributed. The intention of this award is to demonstrate 
that service to the Python community does lead to recognition and reward, rather than to provide a 
direct incentive to contributors.

Awards will be made periodically (a few times a year), although the Global Council may choose to 
consider awards more or less frequently. The award is open to women and non-binary PyLadies. Any
Python community member may nominate a PyLady at any time. Self-nominations are accepted. Nominations
must be made through [this Google form] (optionally anonymous). The Council will contact nominators to
keep them informed of the status of their nominations.

While it would be unusual for a single individual to receive multiple awards, repeated awards will be 
appropriate to acknowledge ongoing contributions.

Award winners will be recognized at the next PyCon US. While nominations are accepted year-round, the 
cut-off date to have nominations considered in time for the upcoming PyCon is the end of the 
previous year. For instance, for PyCon US 2025, nominations must be received by December 31st, 2024 
[AOE]. This is to give enough time for the Council to review nominations, and for award winners to 
make travel arrangements for the conference.

:::{attention}
**PyCon 2024 timing**: Since the Council is just announcing this award, for the first year, we're 
accepting nominations until February 4th, 2024 [AOE]. Nominations received after this date will
still be considered, but may not be notified in time for PyCon US 2024.
:::

Award winners will receive an award certificate plus one free registration to PyCon US (ideally, the
upcoming PyCon US to receive the award) and the opportunity to apply for a grant for travel and 
accommodation expenses. 

### Remaining Details

The full award process and award details are still being worked out. To be transparent, these are the
remaining details that the Global Council needs to sort out:

* Finalization of award gifts (in addition to what's already stated above)
* Should we keep a public record (e.g. on this doc) of historial winners? With the option to opt-out
* If yes to above, where should the public record be? On this doc? on the [PyLadies website]? [Blog]? elsewhere?
* Should we also announce on social media?
* How should we handle nominees who have received the PSF [Community] or [Distinguished] Service awards for similar reasons?
