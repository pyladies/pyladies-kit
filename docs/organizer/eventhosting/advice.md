## Dealing with volunteer/organizer burnout

Organizing a PyLadies group is hard work, and no less for the people who volunteer to help out. {doc}`burnout <../difficult/burnout>` is a page to help recognize and deal with signs of burnout.

## Dealing with unwelcome people

Some people are jerks. It can be difficult to handle situations in which an unwanted person attends events, or otherwise is not a supporter of PyLadies. 
Check out {ref}`coc-respond` on how to handle people that violate the PyLadies {ref}`coc`.
Don't be afraid to ask someone to leave the event (or request the venue host to act as a "bouncer" for you).
And if that person refuses, please feel comfortable/empowered to call local authorities requesting for help.
