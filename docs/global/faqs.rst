Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Can men attend local PyLadies group events?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It’s up to the local organizer, and usually explicitly stated within an event's description Generally, groups will hold some women-only events  as well as events for both genders (either women and +1 guests, or anyone who wants to attend).


Is there anything like PyLadies specifically for men?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There doesn’t seem to be a burning need for a PyLadies for Men ;) That said, you're welcome to start any group that fits your needs or concerns.

One enterprising gent has printed “PyLaddies” shirts, and there is an IRC channel on Freenode, #pygents, for the men who love PyLadies =)

Can I use the PyLadies logo and graphics for any purpose?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes! But please read our :ref:`logo usage policy <logo-policy>`.

TL;DR is that any of the graphics in our `PyLadies assets repo`_ can be used for local group promotion and/or to show your support.

Logos used with the intention to sell merchandise, please seek permission from the `PyLadies leadership`_.

There is "official" merchandise sold - with proceeds going towards PyLadies - at our own `spreadshirt site`_.

Can transgender women be PyLadies?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anyone who considers herself a woman and does Python is a PyLady/Python lady. We support all women, whether female by birth or not.

If the idea of trans people is new to you, you might want to take a look at `this fantastic illustrated book about gender <http://www.thegenderbook.com>`_, `this comic <http://www.roostertailscomic.com/?p=1495>`_, or any of the many other introductions to trans issues on the internet.

Is your goal to segregate by gender?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No! PyLadies and local PyLadies groups are about making the Python community explicitly welcoming and accessible to women.

Women who wouldn’t otherwise attend a Python user group meeting often attend local PyLadies group events, as a gateway to getting involved with Python programming as a beginner, or getting more involved in the Python community as an intermediate/advanced developer.


What if my question isn’t answered here?
