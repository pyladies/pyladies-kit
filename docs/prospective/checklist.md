# Checklist

Here's all of what needs to be done to start a PyLadies group locally.  You may of course adapt this list to meet your groupâ€™s needs.

**PART 1**

```{raw} html
<form action="">
<ul>
    <ol><input type="checkbox" name="coorgs" value="">If you need, find some co-organizers to help with organization and planning.</input></ol>
    <ol><input type="checkbox" name="namespace" value="">Decide the namespace of your group (e.g. <code>portland.pyladies.com</code> or <code>pdx.pyladies.com</code>, same with email addresses).</input></ol>
    <ol><input type="checkbox" name="reqform" value="">Fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18GjETzcU1KeqdrOMASeyCCNyl_wvWKpunUauLt6opS8/viewform">initial PyLadies group interest form</a> to get your namespace setup for your group domain and email.</input></ol>
</ul>

```

Once you have received a confirmation that the the initial PyLadies request form was approved and setup, continue on:

**PART 2**

```{raw} html
<form action="">
<ul>
    <ol><input type="checkbox" name="social" value="">Sign up for Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and/or any social network that would be effective in your location.  We suggest to use your @pyladies.com email.</input></ol>
    <ol><input type="checkbox" name="meetup" value="">Start up a Meetup.com group for your location.  <br><blockquote><b>Tip:</b> Uber-frugal?  Get half-price Meetup fees!

In 24 hours, you will receive an e-mail from Meetup.com, with a link to complete the payment process at half price. :) </blockquote></input></ol>
    <ol><input type="checkbox" name="meetup" value="">Join the Python Software Foundation Meetup Pro network by <a href="https://psfmember.org/grant-proposals/">submitting a grant request from the PSF</a>.</input></ol>
