# Logo Usage

PyLadies and the PyLadies logo are trademarks of the Python Software Foundation.  The full trademark usage policy can be read here: {doc}`trademark`.

In general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to indicate the support of or involvement with PyLadies. If you are a local PyLadies leader, you are free to adapt the logo to your location.  However, non-leaders, please [ask] first when using a derived version of the logo or when in doubt.

## The PyLadies Logo

The standard PyLadies wordmark logo (cursive writing) can be found in the `wordmark` directory of our [pyladies-assets] repository.  Use in combination with the PyLadies Geek logo (described below) is permitted. You may alter the colors of the wordmark but not the size or proportions.
