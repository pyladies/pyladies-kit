# For Members

## About PyLadies

We are an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate!

## Joining

Want to join PyLadies? Fantastic!  But I hate to break it to you, you already are one ;-).

### Finding your local PyLadies

We (try to) maintain a list of PyLadies [locations], but it may not be complete or up-to-date as every location is reponsible for updating & maintaining their location's information.

```{important}
If you believe that there is a location not shown on our [locations] page, please feel free to ping the organizer (if you know them), [file an issue] or [submit a pull request] with the relevant information!
```

Once you find your location, go ahead and join their Meetup.com group (if they have one), and join/follow any social media accounts they have.

### Remote PyLadies

We can't be everywhere.  But we're trying!  For those who do not have a PyLadies group within a reasonable distance (or even if you do!) we have an online PyLadies group called [Remote PyLadies]!  Events are held by local organizers through online streaming/coding/etc tools and posted on the [Remote PyLadies] site.

### Want to volunteer?

Often times, our organizers - both local & remote - need help.  Whether it's mentorship for events, logistic help (e.g. a door woman).  Don't be shy in reaching out to them!  Their contact information *should* be listed on our [locations] page.  But if you're having trouble, please feel free to [ping us] for introductions.

## Difficult Stuff
