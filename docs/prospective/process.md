# Process Overview

Everything is listed in {doc}`checklist`, but an overview of the process is:

1. Think about who you'd like to have help you, if you'd like.
2. Think about the name of the location.  For instance, do you want "PyLadies of Super Awesome City", or "Super Awesome City PyLadies", or "SACPyLadies"? We **highly** encourage to not choose a name that is the whole country or state, e.g. "PyLadies of California".  We do not want to discourage other women from starting a local PyLadies, say "PyLadies of Santa Barbara" when "PyLadies of California" is only focusing on the Bay Area.
3. Fill out the initial interest form (linked in the checklist).
4. If you haven't heard from anyone within a week, please [ping us]!  Once you do, you will be given a PyLadies email address, which is also your Google Apps account.
5. Sign up for ALL the things with your new PyLadies email address, like Meetup.com, Twitter, Facebook, or anything that's relevant to your location.
6. If you have signed up for Meetup, you may request reimbursement of fees paid from the Python Software Foundation.  Check out their [grant process] for more information, as well as a {doc}`../organizer/grants/sample-meetup-proposal`.
7. Think about how you want to setup your website (e.g. a static HTML/CSS/JS site, or a dynamic site with Django/Flask/etc).  More information in {doc}`../organizer/website/local`
8. Fill out the PyLadies resource form with all the new accounts (linked in the checklist).
9. Start hosting events!
