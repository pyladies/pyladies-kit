Prospective Organizers
======================

So you’ve decided to start your own PyLadies group – **YAY!**

We’re excited to have people like you join our growing community and want to help you get your group launched as quickly and painlessly as possible. If our experience is any indication, your first major event will galvanize and inspire the Python community in your area and create momentum for subsequent events, so it’s crucial to start things off on the right foot!

To help you get started, we’ve created this open-source kit for starting your own PyLadies group in your city. PyLadies is part social club, part stepping stone toward the Python open-source world.


Things to Think About
---------------------

Types of Local Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A local group can be:

#. a geographic group: for a city, region, state, or country
#. a student group: for a university, college, or school
#. an interest group: for any topic (e.g. PyGame, SciPy, Django)

The larger the local group, the harder it is to meet in person. Large local group's events will be mostly virtual meetups that occur online, whereas small local group's events tend to be in-person meetups.

A local group can consist of sub-local-groups, making both the in-person and virtual meetups possible.

Group Size
~~~~~~~~~~

It’s fine if your local group is small. Having just 2-3 women who meet regularly to exchange Python tips and tricks counts as a local group. What matters most is *quality*, not quantity.

Larger local groups have more flexibility to organize different types of events, but it’s harder to get everyone together for dinner.


Event Frequency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no formal requirements for how often a leader hold events.  However, we highly encourage that - at minimum, to try and hold one event a month.  This helps keep interest in PyLadies from flagging, and helps people maintain their progress in becoming better developers. You can hold more events with proper support and planning.

Suggestions for event types and event resources can be found under :doc:`../organizer/eventhosting/ideas` and :doc:`../organizer/eventhosting/resources/index`.

Process Overview
----------------

Everything is listed in :doc:`checklist`, but an overview of the process is:

1. Think about who you'd like to have help you, if you'd like.
2. Think about the name of the location.  For instance, do you want "PyLadies of Super Awesome City", or "Super Awesome City PyLadies", or "SACPyLadies"? We **highly** encourage to not choose a name that is the whole country or state, e.g. "PyLadies of California".  We do not want to discourage other women from starting a local PyLadies, say "PyLadies of Santa Barbara" when "PyLadies of California" is only focusing on the Bay Area.
3. Fill out the initial interest form (linked in the checklist).
4. If you haven't heard from anyone within a week, please `ping us`_!  Once you do, you will be given a PyLadies email address, which is also your Google Apps account.
5. Sign up for ALL the things with your new PyLadies email address, like Meetup.com, Twitter, Facebook, or anything that's relevant to your location.
6. If you have signed up for Meetup, you may request reimbursement of fees paid from the Python Software Foundation.  Check out their `grant process`_ for more information, as well as a :doc:`../organizer/grants/sample-meetup-proposal`.
7. Think about how you want to setup your website (e.g. a static HTML/CSS/JS site, or a dynamic site with Django/Flask/etc).  More information in :doc:`../organizer/website/local`
8. Fill out the PyLadies resource form with all the new accounts (linked in the checklist).
9. Start hosting events!

DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please do *not* purchase domains or setup email addresses; we do that for you!  We need to maintain accounts (both for trademark and administrative purposes).


Process Checklist
-----------------

Here's all of what needs to be done to start a PyLadies group locally.  You may of course adapt this list to meet your group’s needs.

**PART 1**

Fill out the `initial PyLadies group interest form`_ to get your namespace setup for your group domain and email.  If you haven't heard anything within a week, please `ping us`_!

Once you have received a confirmation that the the initial PyLadies request form was approved and setup, continue on:

**PART 2**

1. With the new ``@pyladies.com`` email address, sign up for the following social media/communications accounts (if it makes sense for your local group):

    1. Twitter
    2. Facebook
    3. GitHub
    4. Slack
    5. IRC/Freenode


2. Whether it's Meetup.com or another local event/community site, start the local group with the ``pyladies.com`` email address.

.. note::

    TIP!  Uber-frugal?  Get half-price Meetup fees!  Complete all of the Meetup forms, but stop when you reach the payment page. In 24 hours, you will receive an e-mail from Meetup.com, with a link to complete the payment process at half price. :)


.. _meetup:

3. If your Meetup groups' 6-month subscription is $89.94 USD (or equivalent) or more, please contact accounting@python.org to request being added to the PSF Meetup Pro network and include a link to your group's code of conduct.

   Meetup subscription reimbursement requests should be submitted within 120 days from the start of a meetup subscription period or the reimbursement will not be approved. For example, if a meetup subscription period begins on June 25, 2018, the organizer may submit a grant request before June 25, 2018 or up to October 23, 2018.

.. note::

    Reimbursements of meetup subscriptions made to PSF fiscal sponsorees are not charged against the fiscal sponsoree's fund balance.
    If you would like more detail go to the `PSF FAQ page`_.

4. Sign up for a Heroku account with your ``pyladies.com`` email address.  This will be used to setup your website, which is documented at :doc:`../organizer/website/local` once you're ready.

5. Fill out the `PyLadies resource form`_ for contact information, all group information, etc.  This is for administrative purposes (e.g. what social media accounts do we own, where should we send PyLadies stickers to, etc), and will not ever be shared outside of PyLadies.

6. Request to join the following mailing lists:

    1. `PyLadies Global Organizers list`_ - all global organizational communication and coordination is done via this list.  You'll be introduced to the mailing list.
    2. `PyLadies Global Members list`_ - a global list for PyLadies (and PyGent allies) members. Feel free to introduce yourself and the new location.

7. Join the `Pyladies Slack group`_. If you're familiar with IRC, come hang out in the ``#pyladies`` channel on Freenode.

8. Plan your first event!  Check out :doc:`../organizer/neworganizer` for New Organizer information. Start promoting your new group via various local channels, including meetup.com, local PUGs, related groups, and universities, as well as the global PyLadies Members list!
