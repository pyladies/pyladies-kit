# Code of Conduct

All PyLadies events (Meetups, conference lunches, etc), online spaces (IRC, Facebook, etc) are beholden to the PyLadies {doc}`../../coc`.

Every PyLadies location is **required** to make {doc}`../../coc` public in some way.  For instance, PyLadies SF has a dedicated [page] on their Meetup space.  The `#pyladies` IRC channel on Freenode has a link to the [main website's] Code of Conduct in the topic of the channel.

Please read {doc}`../difficult/responding` for how to appropriately deal with CoC violations.
