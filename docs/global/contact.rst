Points of Contact
-----------------

`Our general email`_  is the best place to shoot any questions you may have.

.. _Our general email: info@pyladies.com

If you have more casual questions, Slack or IRC is one of the best places to start.  You can usually find several of the main PyLadies points of contact in #pyladies.

Online Community
----------------

Whether or not you’re part of a local group, the PyLadies community online welcomes you on Slack as well as IRC.

Slack
~~~~~

We have a Pyladies Slack group that you can join by visiting the `Slack sign-up link`_.    

You can find channels for your local chapter in the Slack group, as well as create new channels for your location, interests, etc. 

IRC
~~~

We have an IRC channel ``#pyladies`` that is on ``irc.freenode.net``. Instructions on how to chat in #pyladies IRC are `here`_.

.. _here: http://www.pyladies.com/blog/irc-resources/

Quite a few well-known men and women in the Python community participate there and try to keep it a friendly place. Ask Python questions there, talk about what your local group is up to, or just say hi.

Anyone can plan and host virtual meetups in IRC #pyladies. You should host one! Just tell one of the ops to update the topic with info about your meetup. See the “Promotion” section for further details about how we can help spread word.

You can also create #pyladies-whatever IRC channels for your country, language, interest group, etc. Ask sandpy for help registering your channel under the #pyladies namespace.


Social Media
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have a `Facebook Community`_ page where all PyLadies and PyLadies-allies are welcome to post and participate in discussions. We also tweet from the official `PyLadies Twitter`_ handle.
