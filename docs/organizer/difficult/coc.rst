Code of Conduct
===============

All PyLadies events (Meetups, conference lunches, etc), online spaces (IRC, Facebook, etc) are beholden to the PyLadies :doc:`../../coc`.

Every PyLadies location is **required** to make :doc:`../../coc` public in some way.  For instance, PyLadies SF has a dedicated `page`_ on their Meetup space.  The ``#pyladies`` IRC channel on Freenode has a link to the `main website's`_ Code of Conduct in the topic of the channel.

Please read :doc:`../difficult/responding` for how to appropriately deal with CoC violations.
