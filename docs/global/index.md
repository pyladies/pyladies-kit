# The Global Organization

The global PyLadies community has no formal organization behind it; no board of directors, no appointed leadership. 
We found that PyLadies growth and success stems from being decentralized and non-bureaucratic.

## Contact

We do have a few point people that can answer and address general, or non-location specific PyLadies questions.
If you are not a local PyLadies leader, please check out {doc}`contact`.
