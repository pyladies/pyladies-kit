# New Organizer Reference

## Email & Google Apps

All PyLadies locations will have their own general email address (e.g. `nyc@pyladies.com`).  You and your other co-organizers can manage that email address how you'd like (e.g. all co-organizers can log in; all email is forwarded; only one organizer manages it; etc).

The `@pyladies.com` email account management is setup with Google Apps. Therefore, every `@pyladies.com` address also has Google Drive.  We **highly** encourage you to use Google Drive for form collection of any sort, document management, etc.

You can also leverage the Google Apps account with your own local Google+ Community/Profile page, Google Contacts & Calendar, and the like.

It is also good practice to keep personal and PyLadies communications separate.  You can easily do this if you use the Chrome browser and setup [two separate profiles] - one for personal and one for PyLadies.

## Account & Password Management

Please sign up for all accounts related to your PyLadies location with the `@pyladies.com` email address.  This is so that handover to a future organizer is a lot smoother, and account recovery is easier.

We highly suggest you use a unique password for each account you use for your PyLadies location.  [LastPass] is a password manager (so you don't have to remember every unique password) that allows you to create unique and difficult-to-guess passwords, as well as save them for you.

[LastPass] also allows you to [share] passwords with folks; so you can setup your local PyLadies Facebook account, then store that password in [LastPass], and allow your co-organizers to log in with that stored password by sharing it.

## Meetup

Whether it's Meetup.com or another local event/community site, start the local
group with the `pyladies.com` email address.

If your Meetup groups' 6-month subscription is \$89.94 USD (or equivalent) or
more, please contact <mailto:accounting@python.org> to request being added to the PSF
Meetup Pro network and include a link to your group's code of conduct.

Meetup subscription reimbursement requests should be submitted within 120 days
from the start of a meetup subscription period or the reimbursement will not be
approved. For example, if a meetup subscription period begins on June 25, 2018,
the organizer may submit a grant request before June 25, 2018 or up to October 23, 2018.

## Social Media

You are free and encouraged to use any social media that you'd like (be sure to register the account with your `@pyladies.com` email address! See {ref}`acctmgmt`).

Be sure to fill out the [PyLadies Resource Form] for data collection so we can be aware of your local "footprint" - both for PSF trademark reasons (to know if the use of the PyLadies name is legitimate) and for account recovery/handover process.

## Logo Use & Adaptation

You may of course use the PyLadies Wordmark and PyLadies Geek logos for promotion, and/or alter them to adapt to your location.  Check out our [locations] page for inspiration.

Please read our {doc}`../misc/trademark`, especially if you plan on using the logos to print merchandise for sale.
