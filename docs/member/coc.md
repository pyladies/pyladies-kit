# Our Code of Conduct

## Policy 

All PyLadies events (Meetups, conference lunches, etc), online spaces (Slack, Facebook, etc) are beholden to the PyLadies <project:#code-of-conduct>.

Every PyLadies location is **required** to make <project:#code-of-conduct> public in some way.  For instance, PyLadies SF has a dedicated [page] on their Meetup space.  The {ref}`PyLadies Slack org<slack>` `#general` channel has a link to the [main website's] Code of Conduct in the topic of the channel.

If you can not find the following Code of Coduct posted somewhere (e.g. wherever they post events), please reach out to your locations' organizers.
