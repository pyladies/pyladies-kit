# Python Software Foundation Grant Proposal Sample

Month Year

LeaderFirst LeaderLastName Organizer, Pyladies Location <mailto:email@email.com>

**Grant Proposal:** \$72 to cover the cost of Pyladies Location’s
Meetup.com subscription for six months, August 2014 through January
2015\.

**Grant Objective:** Fund the use of Meetup.com for organizing and
managing Pyladies Madison for a six month period. Meetup.com helps to
increase the visibility of the user group, as well as boost attendance
through automated reminders, RSVP functionality, and other tools. It
also makes organizing and promoting the group easier, as well as
providing a platform to garner sponsorships and thank sponsors publicly.

**Grant Size:** \$72 total, which is the cost of 6 months to organize a
group on Meetup.com.

**Grant Beneficiaries:** Pyladies Madison is one of the newest groups
of Pyladies. The Meetup.com account is a critical piece of getting the
group off of the ground. The site is already used widely by other Tech
Meetup groups in the Madison area and is one of the first places people
will look for new meetup opportunities. Meetup.com is a well-known site
for people looking for like-minded individuals, providing us good
visibility for new members. It also cross-promotes groups to each other,
encouraging members of other tech groups to consider joining ours.

Meetup.com provides a centralized location where our members see what’s
coming up and who has RSVPed for the meeting. Members can also leave
comments about the group itself.
