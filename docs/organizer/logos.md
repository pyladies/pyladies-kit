# Logos

Please read our {doc}`logo usage policy <../misc/logo>`, but in general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to indicate the support of or involvement with PyLadies. If you are a local PyLadies leader, you are free to adapt the logo to your location.  (Non-leaders, please [ask] first when using a derived version of the logo or when in doubt).

TL;DR is that any of the graphics in our [PyLadies assets repo] can be used for your own group promotion and/or to show your support.  You may also alter the PyLadies Wordmark or PyLadies Geek logo to adapt it to your location. Check out examples on our [locations site](http://www.pyladies.com/locations).

Logos used with the intention to sell merchandise, please seek permission from the [PyLadies leadership] to help setup.

There is "official" merchandise sold - with proceeds going towards PyLadies - at our own [spreadshirt site].  It's probably better to go with a bulk t-shirt printer if buying more than a few t-shirts though.  You're free to choose a printer that you like or that may be local.  We've had good luck with [Elegant Stitches] (who printed the PyCon 2015 t-shirt) and [Custom Ink].
