## Swag: T-Shirts, Stickers, and Other Merchandise

Currently, T-shirts are available via [Spreadshirt](https://shop.spreadshirt.com/pyladies/). Proceeds from the shop benefit the PyLadies organization and go toward things like nonprofit corporation setup, helping new local groups, servers, etc.

Sometimes we also create limited runs of T-shirts, stickers, etc. Check the blog or ask around in IRC #pyladies if you’re interested in seeing what we have.

## Local group merchandise

If you’d like to create merchandise for your own local group, you can create a shop on Spreadshirt, Zazzle, or any other print-on-demand site and have the proceeds go toward your local group.

Or you can have a local print shop print a small run.
