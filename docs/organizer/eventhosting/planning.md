# Event Planning

## Types of Local Groups

A local group can be:

1. a geographic group: for a city, region, state, or country
2. a student group: for a university, college, or school
3. an interest group: for any topic (e.g. PyGame, SciPy, Django)

The larger the local group, the harder it is to meet in person. Large local group
events will be mostly virtual meetups that occur online, whereas small local group
events tend to be in-person meetups.

A local group can consist of sub-local-groups, making both the in-person and
virtual meetups possible.

## Group Size

It’s fine if your local group is small. Having just 2-3 women who meet regularly
to exchange Python tips and tricks counts as a local group. What matters most is *quality*, not quantity.

Larger local groups have more flexibility to organize different types of events,
but it’s harder to get everyone together for dinner.

## Event Frequency

We highly encourage that you hold regular events. At least once or twice a year.
Some groups aim to hold one event a month. This helps keep interest in PyLadies
from flagging, and helps people maintain their progress in becoming better developers.
You can hold more events with proper support and planning.
