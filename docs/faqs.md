# FAQs

## General

### Can men join PyLadies?

Anyone can be a PyLady – only condition is to love (or at least want to learn) Python.

However, please [be respectful of local events](#can-men-attend-local-pyladies-group-events) and the policies that local chapters set up.

### Can transgender women join PyLadies?

Anyone can be a PyLady – only condition is to love (or at least want to learn) Python.

### Can non-binary people join PyLadies?

Anyone can be a PyLady – only condition is to love (or at least want to learn) Python.

### Is your goal to segregate by gender?

No! PyLadies and local PyLadies chapters are about making the Python community explicitly welcoming and accessible to women & non-binary folks.

Women and non-binary people who wouldn’t otherwise attend a Python user group meeting often attend local PyLadies events, as a gateway to getting involved with Python programming as a beginner, or getting more involved in the Python community as an intermediate/advanced developer.

### Where can I get PyLadies swag?
There is "official" merchandise sold - with proceeds going towards PyLadies - at our own [spreadshirt site].

We also regularly sell t-shirts and give away stickers at the annual PyCon US conference. We might be at other conferences, too.

## Organizers

### Can men attend local PyLadies group events?

It’s up to the organizers of the chapter. Generally, it’s good to hold women- & non-binary-only events as well as events for everyone (either women/non-binary and +1 guests, or anyone who wants to attend).
Just be aware that the dynamic of the room tends to change when the male:female ratio becomes lopsided.

A good way to hold an all-inclusive event is to partner with a local Python user group.

Be extra-clear in your event description about whether men are allowed/what the rules are – it will save you a lot of time, and prevent awkward conversations.

### How can I make my chapter inclusive?

We encourage you sure to make trans women and non-binary folks feel welcome by saying so in your meetup group and event descriptions. 
Here is an example of a statement you could include:

> PyLadies \[chapter\] is welcoming to and respectful of transgender and non-binary people. We
> encourage all women and non-binary folks to come out to our meetups.

If the idea of trans & non-binary people is new to you, you might want to take a look at [this fantastic illustrated book about gender](http://www.thegenderbook.com), [this comic](http://www.roostertailscomic.com/?p=1495), or any of the many other introductions to trans issues on the internet.

_Have more resources? Awesome - please [contribute]!_

### Can I use the PyLadies logo and graphics for any purpose?

Yes! But please read our {ref}`logo usage policy <logo-policy>`.

TL;DR is that any of the graphics in our [PyLadies assets repo] can be used for local group promotion and/or to show your support.

Logos used with the intention to sell merchandise, please seek permission from the [PyLadies leadership].

### How do I ask the PSF to cover Meetup fees?

The PSF financially hosts worldwide Python Meetups on their [Meetup Pro Network](https://www.meetup.com/pro/python-software-foundation-meetups) as long as 3 conditions are met:

1. The Meetup holds at least 2 events per calendar year (virtual or in-person).
2. Event content focuses on Python content at least 70% of the time. Content may include adjacent topics, such as networking, basic machine learning, etc.   
3. The Meetup posts the PyLadies {ref}`Code of Conduct <coc>` in the About tab of the Meetup page to become and stay eligible for the PSF Meetup Pro network.
