For Prospective Organizers
==========================

So you’ve decided to start your own PyLadies group – **YAY!**

We’re excited to have people like you join our growing community and want to help you get your group launched as quickly and painlessly as possible. If our experience is any indication, your first major event will galvanize and inspire the Python community in your area and create momentum for subsequent events, so it’s crucial to start things off on the right foot!

To help you get started, we’ve created this open-source kit for starting your own PyLadies group in your city. PyLadies is part social club, part stepping stone toward the Python open-source world.

.. note::

Guidelines for Starting Your Own Group
--------------------------------------

When you start your own PyLadies group, you'll be helping to build and grow local
Python community, through meetups, or sharing info through mailing lists, twitter, etc.

A PyLadies group is not meant for a one-time event or workshop. There is an expectation
for ongoing community activities through your group, at least once or twice a year.
Some of our groups are aiming for monthly events.

Ideally the organizers in your group should be women or women majority. We also
require at least two co-organizers in your group to help share the workload
and prevent burnout from any single organizer.

When requesting a chapter, we ask that it be local and city-based. If an existing
chapter already exists in your city, a second one may be allowed depending on
circumstances.

Role and Responsibilities of the Organizer
------------------------------------------

Once your group has been approved, you and your group agree to use your group's
``@pyladies.com`` email address to conduct your business. For example,
for any email communications with your members, and for creating meetup
and social media accounts.

You may be asked from time to time to share any news from Global PyLadies leadership
team to your members.

You will help organize or support co-organization of at least one meetup per year.

You're not necessarily expected to be the one creating content, or giving talk
or workshop. It is expected for you to invite local speakers, and create opportunities
for aspiring new speakers among your members.

You may be asked to provide a report of your group activities once a year to the
Global PyLadies Leadership team.

You will be responsible to notify Global PyLadies leadership of changes in your
organizing team. For example, if you have new organizers, or if an organizer stepped down.

Process overview
----------------

1. Prior to starting your own PyLadies group, please first join our `Pyladies Slack group`_,
   and head to ``#prospective-organizers`` channel. We encourage you to seek
   mentorship from experienced organizers, and for you to ask questions about
   starting your own group.

2. Once you're ready to start your own group, please fill in the `New Chapter Registration Form <https://forms.gle/QFUcNSRGE3XqzPu76>`_.

3. We review new chapter requests once per month. Your request will be reviewed
   in the following month after you filed your request. For example, if you
   filled in the form on March 2020, it will be reviewed on April 2020.

4. If we approve your request, we will create your group's ``@pyladies.com`` email
   address and give you the credentials.

5. Once you receive your ``@pyladies.com`` email address, you can then use this
   to start activities for your group. You must use this email address to create
   your Meetup account and other related social media account, like Twitter, Facebook,
   etc.

6. Your contact info (and your co-organizers') will be automatically added to our
   `Organizer Directory <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14--69LWAGhF_DA8iPGRAOoh7GMJ3qFmcMQwASWqPo54/edit?usp=sharing)>`_.
