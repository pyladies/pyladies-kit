# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can men attend local PyLadies group events?

It’s up to the local organizer, and usually explicitly stated within an event's description Generally, groups will hold some women-only events  as well as events for both genders (either women and +1 guests, or anyone who wants to attend).

## Is there anything like PyLadies specifically for men?

There doesn’t seem to be a burning need for a PyLadies for Men ;) That said, you're welcome to start any group that fits your needs or concerns.

One enterprising gent has printed “PyLaddies” shirts, and there is an IRC channel on Freenode, #pygents, for the men who love PyLadies =)

## Can I use the PyLadies logo and graphics for any purpose?

Yes! But please read our {ref}`logo usage policy <logo-policy>`.

TL;DR is that any of the graphics in our [PyLadies assets repo] can be used for local group promotion and/or to show your support.

Logos used with the intention to sell merchandise, please seek permission from the [PyLadies leadership].

There is "official" merchandise sold - with proceeds going towards PyLadies - at our own [spreadshirt site].

## Can transgender women be PyLadies?

Anyone who considers herself a woman and does Python is a PyLady/Python lady. We support all women, whether female by birth or not.

If the idea of trans people is new to you, you might want to take a look at [this fantastic illustrated book about gender](http://www.thegenderbook.com), [this comic](http://www.roostertailscomic.com/?p=1495), or any of the many other introductions to trans issues on the internet.

## Is your goal to segregate by gender?

No! PyLadies and local PyLadies groups are about making the Python community explicitly welcoming and accessible to women.

Women who wouldn’t otherwise attend a Python user group meeting often attend local PyLadies group events, as a gateway to getting involved with Python programming as a beginner, or getting more involved in the Python community as an intermediate/advanced developer.

## What if my question isn’t answered here?
