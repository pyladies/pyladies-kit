  Any PyLadies organizer can view this by logging in using `{{chapter}}@pyladies.com` email address.

## Email & Google Apps

All PyLadies locations will have their own general email address (e.g. `nyc@pyladies.com`).  You and your other co-organizers can manage that email address how you'd like (e.g. all co-organizers can log in; all email is forwarded; only one organizer manages it; etc).

The `@pyladies.com` email account management is setup with Google Apps. Therefore, every `@pyladies.com` address also has Google Drive.  We **highly** encourage you to use Google Drive for form collection of any sort, document management, etc.

You can also leverage the Google Apps account with your own local Google+ Community/Profile page, Google Contacts & Calendar, and the like.

It is also good practice to keep personal and PyLadies communications separate.  You can easily do this if you use the Chrome browser and setup [two separate profiles] - one for personal and one for PyLadies.

## Account & Password Management

Please sign up for all accounts related to your PyLadies location with the `@pyladies.com` email address.  This is so that handover to a future organizer is a lot smoother, and account recovery is easier.

We highly suggest you use a unique password for each account you use for your PyLadies location.  [LastPass] is a password manager (so you don't have to remember every unique password) that allows you to create unique and difficult-to-guess passwords, as well as save them for you.

[LastPass] also allows you to [share] passwords with folks; so you can setup your local PyLadies Facebook account, then store that password in [LastPass], and allow your co-organizers to log in with that stored password by sharing it.

## Meetup

Whether it's Meetup.com or another local event/community site, start the local
group with the `pyladies.com` email address.

You must add a link (or the full text) to the {ref}`PyLadies Code of Conduct <coc>` in the "About" section of your Meetup group.

The PSF financially hosts worldwide Python Meetups on their Meetup Pro Network as long as certain conditions are met. Please see the {ref}`FAQ: How do I ask the PSF to cover Meetup fees? <meetup-fee-reimbursement>` for more information.

## Social Media

You are free and encouraged to use any social media that you'd like (be sure to register the account with your `@pyladies.com` email address! See {ref}`acctmgmt`).

Be sure to fill out the [PyLadies Resource Form] for data collection so we can be aware of your local "footprint" - both for PSF trademark reasons (to know if the use of the PyLadies name is legitimate) and for account recovery/handover process.

## Global Website

When you're ready to go public, you should add yourself to the PyLadies [locations] page.  Please head over to {doc}`website/global` to get started!

## Local Website

Have a few minutes?  Or want to make a local event around creating your local PyLadies website?  Awesome!  Please head over to {doc}`website/local` to get started!
