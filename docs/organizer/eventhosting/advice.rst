Dealing with volunteer/organizer burnout
----------------------------------------

Organizing a PyLadies group is hard work, and no less for the people who volunteer to help out. :doc:`burnout <../difficult/burnout>` is a page to help recognize and deal with signs of burnout.


Dealing with unwelcome people
-----------------------------

Some people are jerks. It can be difficult to handle situations in which an unwanted person attends events, or otherwise is not a supporter of PyLadies.  Check out :doc:`../difficult/responding` on how to handle people that violate the PyLadies :doc:`../difficult/coc`.  Don't be afraid to ask someone to leave the event (or request the venue host to act as a "bouncer" for you).  And if that person refuses, please feel comfortable/empowered to call local authorities requesting for help.
