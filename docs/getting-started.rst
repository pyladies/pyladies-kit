So You’ve Decided to Start Your Own PyLadies Chapter
----------------------------------------------------

**YAY!** We’re excited to have people like you join our growing community and want to help you get your chapter launched as quickly and painlessly as possible. If our experience is any indication, your first major event will galvanize and inspire the Python community in your area and create momentum for subsequent events, so it’s crucial to start things off on the right foot!

To help you get started, we’ve created an open-source kit for starting your own PyLadies chapter in your city. PyLadies is part social club, part stepping stone toward the Python open-source world.

How to use this kit
-------------------

Copy our model (fork & contribute). Or fork and make it completely different. We don’t mind if you get creative!


Checklist
---------

Here's all of what needs to be done to start a PyLadies chapter locally.  You may of course adapt this list to meet your chapter’s needs.

**PART 1**

.. raw:: html

	<form action="">
	<ul>
		<ol><input type="checkbox" name="coorgs" value="">If you need, find some co-organizers to help with organization and planning.</input></ol>
		<ol><input type="checkbox" name="namespace" value="">Decide the namespace of your chapter (e.g. <code>portland.pyladies.com</code> or <code>pdx.pyladies.com</code>, same with email addresses).</input></ol>

	</ul>

Once you have received a confirmation that the the initial PyLaides request form was approved and setup, continue on:

**PART 2**

.. raw:: html

	<form action="">
	<ul>

Complete all of the Meetup forms, but stop when you reach the payment page.
