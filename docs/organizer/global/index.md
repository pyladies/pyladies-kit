# Global PyLadies Community

## About

The global PyLadies community has no formal organization behind it; no board of directors, no appointed leadership.  We found that PyLadies growth and success stems from being decentralized and non-bureaucratic.

We do have a few point people that can answer and address general, or non-location specific PyLadies questions.  If you are not a local PyLadies leader, you may do so via our [general email].  If you are a local PyLadies leader, you may email our [organizers list] (must be added to the [mailing list] first).

## Mailing List

We have a [global mailing list] in which anyone can join. Be sure to fill out the one request:

To be approved, please give a 1-5 sentence bio about yourself, how you heard about PyLadies, and/or how you use Python.

The mailing list is subject to the PyLadies {doc}`../difficult/coc`.

## Newsletter

The Pyladies global newsletter is sent out as regularly as we can make it; all work is voluntary, and all information is volunteered! Everyone who subscribes via the email form on  <http://www.pyladies.com> will receive the newsletter.

### Contributing

The editor of an upcoming issue of the PyLadies global newsletter might make an effort to gather info about all the local groups via a message to the organizers mailing list, but the onus is on each group's organizer(s) to send any updates about a group to the editor if they want to be included.

### Editing

If you'd like to volunteer to edit the next issue, all you have to do is shoot an email to the organizers mailing list! Warning: it's a lot of work!  We use Mailchimp.
