Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

.. begin

This FAQs are specifically for prospective or new local PyLadies organizers.  If you are a member or just curious in learning more about PyLadies, check out the FAQs here: :doc:`../global/faqs`.

Can men attend local PyLadies group events?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It’s up to you Generally, it’s good to hold women-only events as well as events for both genders (either women and +1 guests, or anyone who wants to attend). Just be aware that the dynamic of the room tends to change when the male:female ratio becomes lopsided.

A good way to hold a mixed-gender event is to partner with a local Python user group.

.. note::

    Be **extra-clear** in your event description about whether men are allowed/what the rules are -- it will save you a lot of time, and prevent awkward conversations.


Can I use the PyLadies logo and graphics for any purpose?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes! But please read our :doc:`logo usage policy <../misc/logo>`.

TL;DR is that any of the graphics in our `PyLadies assets repo`_ can be used for your own group promotion and/or to show your support.  You may also alter the PyLadies Wordmark or PyLadies Geek logo to adapt it to your location. Check out examples on our `locations site <http://www.pyladies.com/locations>`_.

Logos used with the intention to sell merchandise, please seek permission from the `PyLadies leadership`_.

There is "official" merchandise sold - with proceeds going towards PyLadies - at our own `spreadshirt site`_.

Can transgender women be PyLadies?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anyone who considers herself a lady and does Python is a PyLady/Python lady. We support all women, whether female by birth or not.

We encourage you sure to make trans women feel welcome by saying so in your meetup group and event descriptions. Here is an example of a statement you could include:

    PyLadies [city] is welcoming to and respectful of trans women. We
    encourage all women to come out to our meetups.

If the idea of trans people is new to you, you might want to take a look at `this fantastic illustrated book about gender <http://www.thegenderbook.com>`_, `this comic <http://www.roostertailscomic.com/?p=1495>`_, or any of the many other introductions to trans issues on the internet.


How do I set up reimbursement for Meetup fees?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PSF will `most likely reimburse <psf-reimburse>`_ your Meetup.com organizer fees for a local Pyladies meetup. Please refer to the :ref:`checklist <meetup>` for more info.


What if my question isn’t answered here?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ask in IRC #pyladies on `freenode <irc>`_ if you wish. But feel free to organize your PyLadies group however you wish, and make it completely your own. We’re here to help you, not to limit you or control your plans.
