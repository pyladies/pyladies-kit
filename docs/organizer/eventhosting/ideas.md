# Event Ideas

By [Barbara Sharette]

## Ideas for meeting spaces/venues

- Local tech company spaces - ask people you know who work there, or ask your own employer if there's a meeting space you can use.  Don't be afraid to find local Python companies and cold-email a public email address!
- For companies willing to let you use their meeting spaces, offer them the chance to do a hiring spiel to open the meeting.
- Check with the organizers of other tech meetup groups for venue ideas.
- Contact local hacker spaces
- Contact local coworking spaces
- Contact your local university's CS department

## Meeting ideas

- Workshops with themes/goals (e.g., one workshop on how to build a small webapp, another one where you try to use python to solve some brainteasers)
- Hold a small competition for your group where there's a goal and you split into two teams and try to solve a problem faster, or better (performance, speed, etc.).
- Beginner Python and Git classes
- Get involved with hack days with other local user groups
- Brainstorm ideas for group projects, so that you have a collection of specific projects to work on for hack nights.
- Leverage Google Hangout to offer support to existing members on matters that hinge more on conversation than on in-person hacking  (e.g., PyLadies recently hosted a hangout to chat about the PyCon call for proposals)

## Getting the word out

- Email the organizers of other tech meetup groups to ask them to help advertise your event.
- Put posters up at universities, or contact the CS student society.  Ask the department secretary to contact grad students.
- Partner with other groups for jointly hosted events
- Get business cards to hand out at events
- Set up a Twitter account
